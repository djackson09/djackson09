# ✨ About Me ✨
Hello everyone!! This is my special personal repository 👩🏽‍💻

I am working on this for my COSC 625 - Advanced Software Engineering class at Frostburg University. I am looking forward to collaborating with my classmates in Git and learning new things about Git through the various projects I work on throughout the semester. 

Fun fact: I have worked on Git at my current place of work, but I have not personally worked through a profile since I was in my junior year of college.

In my free time, I enjoy going to the gym, spending time with friends and family, and watching reality TV 😌
